                moduleAims="Oscillating Systems aims to introduce students to the concepts of periodic and simple harmonic motion. 
                The focus is on understanding the principles behind these types of motion, exploring their characteristics, and delving into the analysis of free and forced vibrations in mechanical systems. 
                Through this study, students will gain a fundamental understanding of the behavior of oscillatory motion in various contexts, providing a basis for further exploration of vibrational phenomena in mechanical systems."
