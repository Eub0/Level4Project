                moduleAims="Nuclear & Particle Physics aims to introduce students to the concept of radioactive decay, providing an understanding of the underlying principles. 
                It delves into the properties of the atomic nucleus, nucleons, and elementary particles, offering insights into the building blocks of matter. 
                The exploration extends to the composition of elementary particles, highlighting the roles of quarks, leptons, and force carriers. 
                Additionally, the course introduces essential concepts of special relativity, including Lorentz transformations and four-vectors. 
                Students will acquire the skills to solve simple relativistic kinematic problems, particularly those involving invariant mass. 
                Through this comprehensive approach, students will gain a foundational understanding of both nuclear physics and the principles of special relativity."
