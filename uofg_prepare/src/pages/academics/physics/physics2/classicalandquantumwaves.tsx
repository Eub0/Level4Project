                moduleAims="Classical & Quantum Waves aims to equip students with the essential mathematical techniques required for a comprehensive understanding of the physics of waves and vibrations, encompassing both classical and quantum aspects. 
                The curriculum involves a detailed examination of standing and traveling wave solutions to the wave equation, providing a solid foundation in wave mechanics. 
                Additionally, the course introduces the concept of matter waves, exploring standing waves as a representation of a particle in a box, and delving into the time-independent SchrÃ¶dinger wave equation. 
                Through this study, students will develop the mathematical proficiency necessary for analyzing waves and vibrations in classical and quantum contexts, laying the groundwork for further exploration in the physics of wave phenomena."
