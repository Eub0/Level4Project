It also aims to introduce the importance of thermodynamics as a core topic in chemistry and how it relates to the study of the transformations of energy, including examples of chemical reactions, equilibrium systems, the effect of external variables on chemical systems, phase transitions and chemical mixing processes. Finally, to gain an appreciation of how thermodynamics enables us to quantify and make predictions about such processes."
