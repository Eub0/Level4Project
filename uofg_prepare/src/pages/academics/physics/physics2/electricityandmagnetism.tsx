                moduleAims="Electricity & Magnetism serves to introduce fundamental concepts in electrical engineering, including capacitance, inductance, impedance, and reactance. 
                Students will explore these concepts to gain an understanding of how they influence electrical circuits and systems. 
                The course also delves into the investigation of electric and magnetic fields, providing a foundation for comprehending their properties and interactions. 
                Through this study, students will acquire essential knowledge for analyzing and designing electrical systems, making connections between the theoretical concepts of capacitance, inductance, impedance, and reactance, and their practical applications in understanding electric and magnetic fields."
