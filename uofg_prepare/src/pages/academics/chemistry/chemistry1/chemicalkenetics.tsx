                moduleAims="Chemical Kenetics aims to show how chemical reactions can be followed and their reaction rates measured. To introduce and demonstrate by means of worked examples the fundamental concepts of the kinetics of spontaneous chemical reactions, and the measurement of reaction rate, reaction order and rate constants. To show how collision theory can be used to explain the effects of concentration and temperature on reaction rates and lead to the Arrhenius equation. To show how catalysts and enzymes influence reaction rate. To explain how kinetics can be used to investigate reaction mechanisms."
